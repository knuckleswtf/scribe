# To include an endpoint that isn't a part of your Laravel app (or belongs to a vendor package),
# you can define it in a custom.*.yaml file, like this one.
# Each custom file should contain an array of endpoints. Here's an example:

#- httpMethods:
#    - POST
#  uri: api/doSomething/{param}
#  metadata:
#    groupName: The group the endpoint belongs to. Can be a new group or an existing group.
#    groupDescription: A description for the group. You don't need to set this for every endpoint; once is enough.
#    title: Do something
#    description: 'This endpoint allows you to do something.'
#    authenticated: false
#  headers:
#    Content-Type: application/json
#    Accept: application/json
#  urlParameters:
#    param:
#      name: param
#      description: A URL param for no reason.
#      required: true
#      example: 2
#      type: integer
#  queryParameters:
#    speed:
#      name: speed
#      description: How fast the thing should be done. Can be `slow` or `fast`.
#      required: false
#      example: fast
#      type: string
#  bodyParameters:
#    something:
#      name: something
#      description: The things we should do.
#      required: true
#      example:
#        - string 1
#        - string 2
#      type: 'string[]'
#  responses:
#    - status: 200
#      description: 'When the thing was done smoothly.'
#      content: # Your response content can be an object, an array, a string or empty.
#         {
#           "hey": "ho ho ho"
#         }
#  responseFields:
#    hey:
#      name: hey
#      description: Who knows?
#      type: string # This is optional
